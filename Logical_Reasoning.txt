Logical Reasoning:

What day is the fourteenth of a given month?

I. The last day of the month is a Wednesday.

II. The third Saturday of the month was seventeenth.


(a) if the data in statement I alone are sufficient to answer the question;

>>>(b) if the data in statement II alone are sufficient to answer the question;
    This is my option due to every time that third saturday is 17 the 14 always be wednesday. For first statement
    depends of the end of the month the date will change (However every time that last day of the month is
    wednesday 30 or Feb 28 coincide with the Wednesday 14)


(c) if the data either in I or II alone are sufficient to answer the question;

(d) if the data even in both the statements together are not sufficient to answer the question;

(e) if the data in both the statements together are needed;


Each Question given below has a problem and three statements numbered I,II and III giving certain information.
You have to decide if the information given in the statements is sufficient for answering the problem.
Remember out of the three statements, each of them alone can also be sufficient to answer the question.
In such cases for example, your answer should be taken as Only I or Only II or Only III and not Only I.
